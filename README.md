# Class Roster Scraper
## What is this?
This crawler scrapes your Canvas courses and gathers the class rosters in a JSON file.
Then it sorts the people based on the criteria that they appear in more than one of your classes.
## Why did I make it?
I had nothing better to do
## How to make the script work?
- First import selenium and beautiful soup and make sure you have Firefox Geckodriver
- Run ``` class_roster_main.py ``` first to get the class roster
- Then run the ``` find_homework_friends.py ``` which will print the sorted list on your console
